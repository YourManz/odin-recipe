# odin-recipe
# A project that the Odin Project recommends completing.

This project is the final milestone in the intro to HTML in the foundations course. The goals include

1. Create a basic and standard HTML boiler plate
2. Include a directory that has recipes in it. Each one their own .html file
3. Link back to the index.html
4. Include an image for each recipe
5. Include an **unordered list** of ingredients
6. Include an **ordered list** of steps
7. Include 3 recipes

Here is my attempt to incorperate these.
